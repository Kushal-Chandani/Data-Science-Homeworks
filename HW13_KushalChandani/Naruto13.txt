Unleash the explosive power of Naruto Uzumaki with his FiguartsZERO - Sage Art Lava Release Rasenshuriken Version!
Naruto fanbases with verified accounts feeding their families by making one piece tweets.
You guys are the best as you are engaging with my Naruto tweets since long and you are so helpful to my timeline and help me increase my reach to people.
Naruto Uzumaki the greatest to ever do it, changed my perspective on life and how i treat others and no matter what i should always push through no matter how bad my situation was. 
A live-action Naruto film? There's only one thing to do. Replace all the characters with diverse women and make them do nothing but complain about the patriarchy.
It's weird. I dislike super exaggerated animation, I will never be the one to defend this scene from Naruto because super abstract stuff is cool, Madoka is a visual treat when they get weird.
I love how Naruto fans have nothing interesting to talk about their own show so they just post engagement bait tweets against other fandoms to entertain themselves.
The thing is even i agree with him that One Piece is better but i also admit admit that he goes overboard with his Naruto tweets.
Today, I'm fulfilling my childhood dream of playing Naruto Ultimate Ninja 3 for the first time!
I love how OP and Naruto fans are engagement baiting by pretending to banter each other via quote tweets. It's pathetic and funny, but smart. Go on with your likes and RTs.
